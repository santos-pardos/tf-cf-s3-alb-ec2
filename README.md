### To provision the resources in this repository:
1. `git clone https://github.com/Kenny-AngJY/Medium-3.git`
2. If you have an ACM certificate in the us-east-1 region and a public Route53 hosted zone. You can modify the default value of the 3 variables below in [./variables.tf](https://github.com/Kenny-AngJY/Medium-3/blob/main/variables.tf)
  > - acm_certificate_arn
  > - hosted_zone_name
  > - hosted_zone_id
3. `terraform init`
4. `terraform plan` <br>
If you left the "acm_certificate_arn" variable empty, there should be 27 resources to be created. Else, 28 resources to be created.
5. `terraform apply` <br>
As no backend is defined, the default backend will be local.

### Clean-up
1. `terraform destroy`
